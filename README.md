## Description 
This is a slot game application that is the same as the slots machines you see in casinos.  



## How to play
How the game works is easy. Push the spin button to begin the game. Continue pushing the spin if you want to keep playing. when done hit the quit button. That is all it takes. GOOD LUCK !



## Logic 
To determine if someone won, I check to see if each image is the same. To do that I associate a number from my initialArray to an image.
